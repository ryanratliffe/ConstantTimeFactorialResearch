# ConstantTimeFactorialResearch
My research on trying to come up with a constant time operation for the computation of a factorial: i.e. i want one non looping hyper efficient equation to compute a factorial.

This project is my last priority behind school so is slow going but i will keep chipping away at it, so far all of my work is independent of the college but might go to a professor for help if the need arises.
